{"name":"Kmerthon","tagline":"a summer k-mer counting contest","body":"### What is the Kmerthon?\r\n\r\nKmerthon is a programming contest open to anyone. The goal is to perform k-mer counting on a set of DNA sequences. \r\n\r\nK-mer counting consists of enumerating all the distinct DNA strings of length k, and reporting the number of times they occur in the dataset. As this is a simple computational problem, you do not need any knowledge in bioinformatics or biology to enter this contest.\r\n\r\n### Why a Kmerthon?\r\n\r\nK-mer counting is an important problem in bioinformatics. It is the first step of hundreds of tools (e.g. DNA assemblers).  [...]\r\n\r\n### How to Participate\r\n\r\nNo registration is required. To enter the contest, submit a Github pull-request to `XXXX`.
